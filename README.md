-  ### Test cases (user story based with screenshots)
      
      -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the restaurant.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text that states the restaurant mission goal.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image that this is a food restaurant website and the area we currently service
        3. The user has two options, click the navigation bar on the right or scroll down to call to action, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first and last page there is a redirection call to action button to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        - Call to Action first and last page

        <img src="readme-docs/firstpagecta.png" width="250">
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is with message confirming the form has 
           been successfully submitted.
           <img src ="readme-docs/confirmmessage.png" width="250">

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the restaurant on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new menu added.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram page.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
-   #### Frequent User Goals
    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added menu or locations.
        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the menu from the nav bar or call to action from contact page.
